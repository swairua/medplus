## 🎯 Features

### Customers Delete Feature

**File**: `src/components/customers/DeleteCustomerModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows customer details (name, code, email, phone, credit limit, status)
- ✅ Displays count of related records being deleted:
  - Invoices
  - Quotations
  - Credit Notes
  - Delivery Notes
  - Payments
  - **Purchase Orders (as supplier)** ⚠️ Critical warning
- ✅ Critical warning if customer is used as supplier in LPOs
- ✅ Requires explicit checkbox confirmation
- ✅ Disabled delete button until confirmed

**Related Data Deleted**:
- All invoices (cascade)
- All quotations (cascade)
- All credit notes (cascade)
- All delivery notes (cascade)
- All payments (cascade)
- All LPOs where customer is supplier (cascade) ⚠️

**Hook**: `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts` → `useDeleteCustomer()`

**Delete Process**:
1. Fetches complete customer record
2. Counts all related records (7 categories)
3. Deletes customer (database cascades delete related records)
4. Creates audit log with full snapshot
5. Invalidates related query caches

**Audit Log Details**:
```json
{
  "action": "DELETE",
  "entity_type": "customer",
  "record_id": "customer-uuid",
  "company_id": "company-uuid",
  "actor_email": "user@example.com",
  "details": {
    "customer_code": "CUST-001",
    "name": "Customer Name",
    "email": "customer@email.com",
    "phone": "+254700000000",
    "credit_limit": 50000,
    "is_active": true,
    "invoices_deleted": 5,
    "quotations_deleted": 3,
    "credit_notes_deleted": 2,
    "delivery_notes_deleted": 1,
    "payments_deleted": 4,
    "lpos_as_supplier_deleted": 2
  }
}
```

### Purchase Orders (LPOs) Delete Feature

**File**: `src/components/lpo/DeleteLPOModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows LPO details (number, supplier, status, total amount)
- ✅ Displays impact summary:
  - Line items to delete
  - Related invoices affected
- ✅ Requires explicit checkbox confirmation
- ✅ Disabled delete button until confirmed

**Related Data Deleted**:
- All LPO items (cascade)
- References in related invoices are preserved (no cascade on invoice→lpo)

**Hook**: `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts` → `useDeleteLPO()`

**Delete Process**:
1. Fetches complete LPO with all items
2. Counts related invoices
3. Deletes LPO (database cascades delete lpo_items)
4. Creates audit log with full snapshot
5. Invalidates related query caches

**Audit Log Details**:
```json
{
  "action": "DELETE",
  "entity_type": "lpo",
  "record_id": "lpo-uuid",
  "company_id": "company-uuid",
  "actor_email": "user@example.com",
  "details": {
    "lpo_number": "LPO-001",
    "supplier_id": "supplier-uuid",
    "status": "draft",
    "total_amount": 150000,
    "items_deleted": 5,
    "invoices_affected": 2
  }
}
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Impact

### Customers Table
- No schema changes
- Uses existing CASCADE constraints for related tables
- Audit logs created in existing `audit_logs` table

### LPOs Table
- No schema changes
- Uses existing CASCADE constraints on `lpo_items`
- Audit logs created in existing `audit_logs` table

### Cascade Relationships

**Customers CASCADE**:
```
customers → invoices (cascade delete)
         → quotations (cascade delete)
         → credit_notes (cascade delete)
         → delivery_notes (cascade delete)
         → payments (cascade delete)
         → lpos [as supplier_id] (cascade delete) ⚠️
```

**LPOs CASCADE**:
```
lpos → lpo_items (cascade delete)
    → (invoices reference lpo_id but no cascade)
```

---

## 🚀 User Interface

### Delete Buttons

**Customers Page**:
- Red trash icon in Actions column
- Accessible for every customer
- Hover tooltip: "Delete customer"
- Destructive styling (red)

**LPOs Page**:
- Red trash icon in Actions column
- Accessible for every LPO
- Hover tooltip: "Delete purchase order"
- Destructive styling (red)

### Confirmation Dialogs

Both dialogs feature:
- **Title** with warning icon and entity name
- **Details Card** showing entity information
- **Impact Alert** listing affected records
- **Critical Warning** (for customer-as-supplier scenario)
- **Confirmation Checkbox** to prevent accidental deletion
- **Cancel/Delete Buttons**

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Customer Deletion Warning

**CRITICAL**: Customers can be used as suppliers in LPOs. Deleting a customer will:
- Delete ALL invoices for that customer
- Delete ALL quotations for that customer
- Delete ALL credit notes for that customer
- Delete ALL delivery notes for that customer
- Delete ALL payments for that customer
- **Delete ALL purchase orders where this customer is used as supplier**

The modal displays a critical warning if the customer is used as a supplier in LPOs.

### LPO Item Preservation

When deleting an LPO:
- All LPO items are deleted (cascade)
- Related invoices that reference the LPO keep their references (no cascade)
- Invoice lines remain intact

## 📊 Audit Trail

### How to Query Deletions

**Find All Customer Deletions**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE entity_type = 'customer' AND action = 'DELETE'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Find All LPO Deletions**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE entity_type = 'lpo' AND action = 'DELETE'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**View Deletion Details**:
```sql
SELECT 
  created_at,
  actor_email,
  details->>'customer_code' as entity_code,
  details->>'invoices_deleted' as invoices,
  details->>'lpos_as_supplier_deleted' as lpos
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE entity_type = 'customer' AND action = 'DELETE';
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### UI Testing
- [ ] Delete button visible on each row (Customers page)
- [ ] Delete button visible on each row (LPOs page)
- [ ] Clicking delete opens confirmation modal
- [ ] Modal displays correct entity details
- [ ] Confirmation checkbox required to enable delete button
- [ ] Cancel button closes modal without deleting
- [ ] Success toast appears after deletion
- [ ] Table refreshes and record disappears

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Delete customer with multiple invoices
- [ ] Delete customer with no related records
- [ ] Delete customer used as supplier in LPOs (verify warning shown)

## 🚨 Error Handling

Both delete implementations include:
- ✅ Record not found error handling
- ✅ Database error handling
- ✅ Audit log failure handling (non-blocking)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages via toast
- ✅ Console warnings for debugging

## 📝 Code Example

### Using Delete Hooks Programmatically

```typescript
// Customers
const deleteCustomer = useDeleteCustomer();
await deleteCustomer.mutateAsync(customerId);

// LPOs
const deleteLPO = useDeleteLPO();
await deleteLPO.mutateAsync(lpoId);
```
