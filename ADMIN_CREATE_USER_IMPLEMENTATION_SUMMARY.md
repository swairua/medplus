- Logs creation to audit trail
- Returns structured response with user_id or error

**Error Handling:**
- 400: Bad request (missing fields, invalid email, invalid role)
- 404: Company not found
- 409: User already exists
- 500: Server errors with descriptive messages

### 1.2 `admin-reset-password` Function
**Location:** `supabase/supabase/functions/admin-reset-password/index.ts`

## 6. User Flow Improvements

### 6.1 Direct User Creation Flow (NEW)
```
Admin → CreateUserModal
  ↓
Enter: email, full_name, password, phone, department, position, role
  ↓
Frontend validation (email format, password strength, required fields)
  ↓
POST to admin-create-user Edge Function
  ↓
Edge Function:
  - Creates Auth user (password hashing in Supabase)
  - Creates profile record (status='active')
  - Logs to audit trail
  - Returns user_id
  ↓
User created immediately (status='active')
  ↓
User can log in immediately
  ↓
Admin can send password reset if needed
```

### 6.2 Password Reset Flow (NEW)
```
Admin → UserManagement → User Actions → Send Password Reset
  ↓
POST to admin-reset-password Edge Function
  ↓
Edge Function:
  - Verifies admin permissions
  - Sends password reset email via Supabase
  - Logs action to audit trail
  ↓
User receives email with reset link
  ↓
User clicks link and sets new password
```

## 7. Database Changes

### No Schema Changes Required
The implementation uses existing tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles
- `companies` - Company records
- `audit_logs` - Auto-created if missing

## 11. Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. ⚠️ **Email invitations not yet implemented** - TODO comment still exists (line 331 in useUserManagement.ts)
2. ⚠️ **No bulk user import** - Can only create one user at a time
3. ⚠️ **No concurrent session limits** - Users can be logged in multiple places
4. ⚠️ **No 2FA for admins** - Should be added for production

### Future Improvements
1. Implement email invitation sending (currently a TODO)
2. Add bulk user import from CSV
3. Implement concurrent session limits
4. Add 2FA requirement for admin accounts
5. Add login history tracking per user
6. Implement session termination by admin
7. Add temporary password generation option
8. Implement user provisioning rules
9. Add SAML/LDAP integration support
10. Add user deprovisioning workflow
