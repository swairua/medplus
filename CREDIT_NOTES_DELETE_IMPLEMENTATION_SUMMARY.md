# Credit Notes Delete Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Audit Review
- Reviewed credit_notes table structure and relationships
- Identified all related tables:
  - `credit_note_items` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  - `credit_note_allocations` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  - `stock_movements` (manual handling)
  - `invoices` (balance adjustment needed)

### 2. Enhanced Audit Logger
**File**: `src/utils/auditLogger.ts`
- Added `'credit_note'` to `AuditedEntity` type
- Now supports deletion audit logging for credit notes
- Maintains detailed snapshots in `details` JSON field

### 3. Created Delete Confirmation Modal
**File**: `src/components/credit-notes/DeleteCreditNoteModal.tsx`
- 182 lines of React component code
- Displays credit note summary with all key information
- Shows impact assessment:
  - Count of line items to delete
  - Allocations to invoices
  - Inventory movements to reverse
- Requires explicit checkbox confirmation
- Prevents accidental deletion with disabled delete button

### 4. Enhanced Delete Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useCreditNotes.ts` (useDeleteCreditNote function)
- Fetches complete credit note with all relationships
- Handles inventory reversals:
  - Finds stock movements with reference_type='CREDIT_NOTE'
  - Creates reversing movements with opposite direction
  - Records reversal count for audit
- Updates invoice balances:
  - For each allocation, recalculates invoice balance_due
  - Formula: `new_balance = old_balance + allocated_amount`
- Performs cascade deletes via database (items, allocations)
- Creates comprehensive audit log entry with:
  - User identification (email, ID)
  - Credit note details snapshot
  - Count of affected records
  - Inventory impact information
  - List of affected invoice IDs

### 5. Updated Credit Notes Page
**File**: `src/pages/CreditNotes.tsx`
- Added DeleteCreditNoteModal import and integration
- Added delete modal state management (showDeleteModal)
- Integrated useDeleteCreditNote hook
- Added Trash2 icon import from lucide-react
- Added delete button to table actions for each row:
  - Destructive styling (red color)
  - Hover tooltip
  - Opens confirmation modal on click
- Wired up delete handler with proper cleanup (refetch)
- Modal displays selected credit note for confirmation

## 📋 Testing Requirements

Comprehensive testing guides provided in:
- `CREDIT_NOTES_DELETE_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Detailed test cases
- `CREDIT_NOTES_DELETE_AUDIT.md` - Documentation and usage

Test Categories:
1. UI/UX Testing (5 test cases)
2. Functional Testing (6 test cases)
3. Audit Logging Testing (3 test cases)
4. Database Integrity Testing (3 test cases)
5. Edge Cases & Error Scenarios (5 test cases)
6. Performance Testing
7. Rollback/Undo Testing

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- User authentication verified before audit logging
- User email and ID recorded for accountability
- Immutable audit logs (cannot be modified)
- Proper error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Status-independent deletion (no special cases)

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- Audit_logs table must exist (created automatically if needed)
- Database must support ON DELETE CASCADE (already configured)
- Stock_movements table must exist for inventory tracking
- Invoices table must have balance_due column

### Migration Steps
1. Deploy updated code
2. No database migrations required
3. Audit_logs table auto-created on first use
4. Feature available immediately

### Rollback Plan
- Revert code changes to previous version
- Audit logs remain as historical record
- No data loss or cleanup needed

## 📚 Documentation

### User Documentation
- Delete button available on each credit note row
- Confirmation modal explains all impacts
- Clear tooltip on button: "Delete credit note"
- Success message confirms completion

### Developer Documentation
- `CREDIT_NOTES_DELETE_AUDIT.md` - Complete technical documentation
- `CREDIT_NOTES_DELETE_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript

## 🎓 Code Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
// Users simply click the delete button in the UI
// Modal handles all confirmation and processing
// No manual API calls needed
```

### Programmatic Usage
```typescript
const { mutateAsync } = useDeleteCreditNote();

// Delete a credit note
await mutateAsync(creditNoteId);

// Success: audit log created, related records updated
// Error: toast notification shows error message
```

### Audit Log Query
```sql
-- Find all deleted credit notes
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE entity_type = 'credit_note' AND action = 'DELETE'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View specific deletion details
SELECT 
  created_at,
  actor_email,
  details->>'credit_note_number' as note_number
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE entity_type = 'credit_note' 
AND record_id = 'credit-note-uuid';
```

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Delete button not visible
- **Solution**: Ensure you're on Credit Notes page and data is loaded

**Issue**: Delete fails with error
- **Solution**: Check console for details, verify related invoices exist

**Issue**: Invoice balance not restored
- **Solution**: Check invoice was allocated to this credit note

### Monitoring
- Monitor audit_logs table for delete patterns
- Alert on unusual deletion activity
- Track inventory reversals for accuracy
- Monitor invoice balance corrections
